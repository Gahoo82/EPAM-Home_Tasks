# A simple and easy method for creating MySQL backups is to use the mysqldump command. This command will 
# create a simple .sql file of an existing database, which can then be restored to any other empty 
# MySQL database. This article will work for any Linux distribution running MySQL.

# 1. Back up the database using the following command:
#     mysqldump -u [username] -p[password] [database_name] > [dump_file.sql]
# The parameters of the said command as follows:
	# [username] - A valid MySQL username.
	# [password] - A valid MySQL password for the user.
	# [database_name] - A valid Database name you want to take backup.
	# [dump_file.sql] - The name of backup dump file you want to generate.

# 2. Restore the backup to a local database server - the mysql command will let you take the contents 
# of a .sql file backup, and restore it directly to a database. This is the syntax for the command:
#     mysql -u [username] -p[password] [database_name] < [dump_file.sql]
 
# 3. Restore the backup to a remote database server - you can also use the mysql command to restore a .sql file
# backup to a remote MySQL server. If you have another server running MySQL, and you have the database
# credentials, you can define a hostname in the command by adding the -h flag to specify a hostname. This 
# changes the syntax of the command to:
#     mysql â€“h [hostname] -u [username] -p[password] [database_name] < [dump_file.sql]
